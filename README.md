Unit Testing: Unit testing refers to the process ofg testing smaller cuhunks of code to verify correctness. A unit test is a small piece of code that checks on whether a specific function or application is working correctly. 

Functional Testing: Functinal Testing is a type of software testing that ensures a product is functioning as designed within the context of software development life-cycle. 

Integration Testing: Intergrating testing is another software testing technique that focuses how well compotents or modules work together. 

Why is Unit Testing preferred by senior developers over other forms of testing?
Unit Testing can empower senior develops with faster productivity as they can make ncessary edits to code without waiting for the full code to be tested. Unit testing will allow developers to document the process of how the code functions and acts in practice, allow for other developers to understand the code at hand.
